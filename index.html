					<div class="about_main_hero">Autism affects 1 in 88 children, 1 in 54 boys and is one of the most underfunded causes in the world</div>
					<div class="about_main_caption">Background Information </div>
					<div class="about_main_description"><p> Medically, it is a neurological disorder, which prevents the brain’s normal development of social and communication skills. Due to this dysfunction, most have a hard time completing even everyday tasks that require their basic five senses. Many refer to autism as an information processing disorder. Autism, to this day, is still a mystery because it is caused by a combination of multiple factors many of which are unknown. We know that it is a neurological brain disorder with genetic influences and most of all, we know how it affects these kids throughout their life. Autism is not a simple disorder that can be cured with medications or a few trips to the psychiatrist but it is something that stays with the person for their whole life. 
					Furthermore, recent budget cuts have caused a decrease in the amount of one-on-one support for autistic students. These students are thus put into separate classes, causing them to feel more secluded and offering them less support, activities and electives. In order to aid in alleviating this problem, “Expression” aims to teach these students with autism some life-long skills that can help them improve their communication, creativity and confidence. Expression aims to give them the one-on-one attention and elective activities that they are missing out on.

Many of the students had a great difficulty communicating their emotions. Sometimes the teachers and students would get very frustrated, due to the lack of understanding what the student wanted or why they were behaving a certain way. After a great deal of research and planning, I organized fundraisers to buy iPads with special applications that would allow them to communicate their thoughts without speaking.

Every week we would try a new activity and develop a new skill. After spending a few weeks using my patient disposition to answer an immeasurable torrent of questions, I realized that their loquacious nature and eagerness for answers illuminated their desire to learn. I treasured their curiosity and powered it with my own enthusiasm to design the activities accordingly. Nothing made my happier than seeing smiles across their faces. Whether it was painting a picture, singing a song, or answering a question, I found myself being drawn into their world of everlasting curiosity, simplicity, and innocence. </p></div>

It engages them, spurs their creativity, improves their communication skills, fine and gross motor skills. </p><p>“Drop a Beat”: Special Needs children gain a number of benefits from singing too. Children who are non-verbal can hum, make sounds, or play musical instruments such as whistles, tambourines, drums, kazoos, or small keyboards. Repeating sounds, making up new tunes, or even learning educational lyrics can be very useful for helping kids to learn and may also provide them some much-needed sensory stimulation - the same they would get from yelling, only this is more pleasing to the ear! Mimicking one another's notes and tunes can be an important social experience that encourages interaction.

		        <div class="content"><p style="background-color:white;">“Get Moving”: They will get to experience the excitement and action of various school sports, and work together for the common goal of winning. Research shows that these activities will be able to improve their gross motor skills and get some exercise by playing new games. Try some common sports such as soccer, basketball, running, etc. Another great activity that works is making an Obstacle Course, where they have to do a number of activities as fast as possible. Activities can include: jumping on trampoline, crawling under the table, moving a chair forward, jumping jacks, jumps on a jumping ball, and running back to the beginning to do it again. Get creative and get moving! </p>
		        <p>“Slow it Down”: Relaxing and slowing down is just as important as increasing their heart rate. Teach them basic, gentle Yoga, breathing techniques and stretching, which have been proven to help improve concentration and reduce hyperactivity.  This is a very useful exercise for these kids because they can do it anytime and it is easy to do. It can help them with coordination and following directions. Yoga can enhance kids' mental, emotional, and physical health through the use of movement, stress management, and the connection between the brain, body, and breath. </p>

		        <div class="title"><p style="background-color:white;">Science</p></div>
		        <div class="content"><p style="background-color:white;">“Cook it”: Ask students to work together to cook simple treats. For example, make trail mix. When making trail mix, each ingredient such as marshmallows, chocolate chips etc., will each be in their own bowl. Each student will receive a zip-lock bag, and then will be asked to scoop each ingredient from each bowl. Students will learn the importance of sharing, waiting for their turn, and only taking a little bit from each bowl so there will be enough for other students. This will also get them to try new things, as many students with autism do not like trying new things. After they make their snack, they will be asked to work together and clean up. Cleaning up is also an important skill to learn. This will be an enjoyable activity, will give them a fun snack to eat, and provide them with some life-long skills.</p><p>“One with Nature”: Do science projects with plant and take nature walks. Start them off with learning about the life of a plant—starting off as a seed, growing in the dirt, receiving sun and water, and turning into healthy tall plant. If old enough, talk about how plants are important to our life because they produce most of the oxygen we breathe. Let each student try to grow their own plant and take care of it for a few weeks. They can experiment using fertilizer, how much water to use, and how much sunlight is needed for the plants to grow. They also learned about the body, and how eating healthy is important.

				Try other science projects that seem interesting and engaging to your students! </p>

		        <div class="title"><p style="background-color:white;">Reading, Writing, and </p><p>Public Speaking </p></div>
		       	<div class="content"><p style="background-color:white;">“Reading and Writing”: Many students with autism are smart but are not able to express themselves well. Writing is a very important skill, which helps them express themselves and communicate their feelings. It will also increase their vocabulary, reading, and language arts skills. Ask your students to keep a journal and write about anything they want. They will improve their writing skills and express themselves. Another activity that we can do is simply reading. Working on reading can be really enjoyable because there are so many good books to read. However, some students do not like to read by themselves, or are not capable of reading for long periods of time. I have seen that they are sometimes more open to learning from other children in their same peer group. Thus, take the time to read out loud to them. Also, give them worksheets between chapters to check how much they have learned. This will not only get the excited about books, but it will enhance their critical reading skills as well. You can even make it more fun by keeping a scorecard on the number of books they read and give them some rewards. </p><p>“Speaking Up”: Public speaking is the number 1 fear in the world, but honestly anyone can overcome it. Start off with simple communication games such as “Charades”. Students would be given a topic, and could choose to go in pairs or by themself and act it out, while the other students would guess what they were acting out. You can even take it up a notch, by teaching them theater and putting on a play. Working together to create a story really encouraged them to speak up, get creative, and play another character. Moreover, if your students are old enough, teach them some speech and debate techniques. In debate, they had to work closely with a partner, think on their feet and create logical arguments for both sides of the topic given. For each topic I gave them, they spent time researching so that their arguments would be supported by moral and value based arguments, extensive evidence, logic, and reasoning. Finally, they built up enough courage to give individual speeches. Before they gave the speech by themselves, we helped them pick a topic, write the speech, and work on body language. Many students are really afraid to speak at the beginning and need guidance to overcome their fear of public speaking. I have witnessed the amazing breakthrough many of the students have had because of this this opportunity to speak up. Try it with your students and you will be surprised!</p>
